It starts with all the income reported to the IRS from employers, brokerages, Social Security, banks, quarterly business filings and more.

If you've heard of 'the line' that is also the AGI as it used to be the last line on the 1040 front page and the first line on the 1040 second page.\n\nWhat the IRS excuses from your total income is referred to as 'Above the Line' deductions.\n\nAfter AGI, the IRS allows another portion of your income to be excused and this is your 'Below the line' deductions before arriving at Taxable Income. That amount is, as you may have figured out, taxed according to tax tables and perhaps Capital Gains rates, to arrive at your Tax which is then compared against what an employer might have withheld to determine what you owe.\n\nFrom there we get into credits which take what you owe and can reduce it to zero thru 'Nonrefundable credits' or even in some cases 'Refundable credits' and put money in your pocket as a refund (or even increase a refund).",
